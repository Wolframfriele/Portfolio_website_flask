        <h2>From 3D animation to AI engineering.</h2>
        <p>I’ve always been passionate about science, technology, and communication.
            Now I want to use my skills to leave the world better than I found it.</p>

        <h1 class="title-right">HELLO, I'M WOLF</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-right">For the last 8 years I’ve been working as a 3D Motion Designer at a few different companies in Amsterdam.
            I’ve always been interested in the intersection of science, technology, and communication though, and my favorite projects
            have been the ones that unite all three.
            <br>
            I recently decided to change my trajectory and move out of advertising and into the field of AI.
            I’m now in my first year of the Open-ICT program at the Hogeschool Utrecht.
            <br>
            When not at school or work, you’ll find me out puzzling through a bouldering problem or running through the woods.</p>

                In this course, you'll dissect the internal machinery of artificial
                neural nets through hands-on experimentation, not hairy
                mathematics. You'll develop intuition about the kinds of problems
                they are suited to solve, and by the end you’ll be ready to dive
                into the algorithms, or build one for yourself.
