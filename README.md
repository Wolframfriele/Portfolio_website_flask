# Original version of my personal website

Build in the first semester of my studies as a way to learn Python and get a portfolio website. This repository is not in used and has been archived, but left on here for demonstration purposes.
While it served as a great way to get my bearings in Python, static site generates are far better for hosting a completly static website.

The structure of this project is heavily based on the Flask tutorial by [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
