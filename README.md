# Original version of my personal website

Build in the first semester of my studies as a way to learn python and get a portfolio website. The code is not in use anymore, but left on here for demonstration purposes.

The structure of this project is heavily based on the Flask tutorial by [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
